# Inclusive Presentations 

Generally, the elements that are favorable towards accesibility are actually considered to be good design practices in the wider sense. So if your presentation is well designed, it should already be accessible to all users. Unfortunately there isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution, but there are a few essential UX design principles to bear in mind that will certainly help. 

Specifically, we write recommendations for the following groups: 

- Color blidness people: Approximately 8% of men and 0.5% of women are colourblind to various extents. There is a wide range of types, and severities, of colourblindness. For more information, there are a number of websites with helpful descriptions
- People with Hearing difficulties: 
- People with sight diffigulties:

## Quick Wins 

- Do not use imaginery that contains sex, violence, or might hurt the sensibility of your large multi-cultural audience. 
- Keep slides clear, simple and uncrowded.- Use minimal text: cover one subject per slide, ideally using no more than six bullet points.
- Ensure every bullet point or item in a list ends with punctuation (e.g. a Full Stop, Semi-Colon or Comma).
- Make the presentation as multi-sensory as possible; use audio-visual elements to reinforce information.- Make the slides available online beforehand.- Use bold for emphasis, rather than highlighting, underlining or italicising. 
- Align text to the left or centrally; do not justify both sides,
- Avoid text which is angled or uses special effects, such as shadows.- Avoid white writing on a dark background.- Dark text on a pastel background works best; dark blue text on cream suits.                                  
## Preparing your slides

- **Don’t only rely only on color to convey a message**: You shouldn’t rely on color alone to convey a message; for example, certain types of color blindness might make it difficult or even impossible to see common red error messages. One approach is to use both colors and symbols where users’ attention is required. A good example of this is Facebook’s form fields and the error messaging attached.

- **Keep it minimal**: You should limit the color palette you use for your presentation; the fewer colors you use in your design, the fewer instances there will be for confusion.

- **Use patterns and textures to show contrast:** Try to use different textures, as opposed to multiple colors, for elements that require emphasis. For example, it might be difficult for color blind users to interpret graphs and charts. In this case, it’s better to use contrasting patterns and, where possible, place text instead. Always include a legend in your graphs. 

- **Avoid bad color combinations**: These are color combinations to avoid because they’re a potential nightmare to color blind users: 
	- *Green & Red, Green & Brown, Blue & Purple, Green & Blue, Light Green & Yellow, Blue & Grey, Green & Grey, Green & Black*
	- High contrast colour schemes can be very hard to see. For instance, a presentation with a white background can make it difficult to see coloured things on the slide, as everything is drowned out by the white background – especially yellow/green text. It is also very tiring to the eye. Try dark-coloured fonts on a light-coloured background.


- **Avoid the use of complex visual effects:**: moving, flashing or dissolving images and graphics are distracting and cause visual distortion. Keep slide transitions consistent and simple.

- **Use Punctuation:** When using bullet points and lists ensure every point is ended with punctuation (e.g. a Full Stop, Semi-Colon or Comma). This will enable a Visual impaired user using a screen reader to distinguish between different ideas. Without the presence of punctuation different ideas will be read as a single sentence and become confusing for the user.

- **Use the right font:** (22 - 226 pt), sans serif fonts, and sufficient white space. Also, be consistent in your use of font, colour and background, and avoid too much variation in font style and size.
	- For people who have dyslexia or have low vision, reduce the reading load. For example, they may benefit from familiar sans serif fonts, such as Arial or Calibri. Avoid using all capital letters and excessive italics or underlines. Include ample white space between sentences and paragraphs.
	- People who have dyslexia describe seeing text “swim together” on a page (the compressing of one line of text into the line below). They often see text merge or distort. 


- **Include alternative text with all visuals and tables**. Alt text helps people who can’t see the screen to understand what’s important in images and other visuals. Visual content includes pictures, clip art, SmartArt graphics, shapes, groups, charts, embedded objects, ink, and videos. Avoid using text in images as the sole method of conveying important information. If you must use an image with text in it, repeat that text in the document. In the alt text, briefly describe the image and mention the existence of the text and its intent.

- **Make sure slide contents can be read in the order that you intend**. When someone who can see reads a slide, they usually read things, such as text or a picture, in the order the elements appear on the slide. In contrast, a screen reader reads the elements of a slide in the order they were added to the slide, which might be very different from the order in which things appear.


- **Add meaningful hyperlink text and ScreenTips**. People who use screen readers sometimes scan a list of links. Links should convey clear and accurate information about the destination. For example, instead of linking to the text Click here, include the full title of the destination page.


- **Accesibility of videos:** If you have videos on your presentation, make sure they are accessible to visually impaired and hearing-impaired users. closed captions typically contain a transcription (or translation) of the dialogue, as well as describe audio cues such as music or sound effects that occur off-screen.

## When Presenting 

- **Be specific when talking about visual elements in your slides:** try not to refer to ‘the red box’. Refer instead to ‘the rounded red box in the top-right of the screen’.

- **Please don’t use red laser pointers**:  The red light is not easily distinguishable on bright screens. Use a green laser pointer instead. Not only are green laser pointers generally more powerful, and therefore brighter, but they are also easier to see.


- **Avoid the use of gender-binary terminology on your presentation**: For example, when welcoming the audience, do not use "ladies and gentlemen", "boys and girls" or similar terminology which is not inclusive. For more information read our recommendations on [collecting gender-inclusive data](gender-in-surveys.md)

- Avoid the use of terminology or examples that might be inpolite towards certain groups, specially minority groups. Also  be mindful of using cliche examples that depict any social groups or communities in a way that can be precieved negatively.  


## Support from Conference Organizers 

- Live Captioning is a great idea for people with difficulties of hearing, and also useful to non-native English speakers. 
- If the talk videos are published, they should include transcriptions.
- Using a Q&A system that does not requires standing, either by bringing microphones to the audience, or by using online Q&A systems such as [sli.do](sli.do)
