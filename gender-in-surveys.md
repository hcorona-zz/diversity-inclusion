## Prior considerations

- When collecting data, you need to proactively communicate the purpose for the self-identification questions.
- When collecting data, you need to emphasize the confidentiality of survey answers in order to address privacy concerns. 
- One overall recommendation is to restate the company’s commitment to non-discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity or expression immediately prior to asking for self-identification and to clearly state the purpose of the question.
- As with all sensitive and confidential data, when asking about gender identity and sexual orientation should take care to protect how the data are used, stored and reported as well as consider any legal restrictions on data collection and storage here in the United States as well as globally.

### Gender Identity, Gender Expression and Sex 

- Gender Identity: A person's internal, deeply held sense of their gender. For transgender people, their own internal gender identity does not match the sex they were assigned at birth. Most people have a gender identity of man or woman (or boy or girl). For some people, their gender identity does not fit neatly into one of those two choices (see non-binary and/or genderqueer below.) Unlike gender expression (see below) gender identity is not visible to others. source: [GLAAD](https://www.glaad.org/reference/transgender) 

- Gender Expression: External manifestations of gender, expressed through a person's name, pronouns, clothing, haircut, behavior, voice, and/or body characteristics. Society identifies these cues as masculine and feminine, although what is considered masculine or feminine changes over time and varies by culture. Typically, transgender people seek to align their gender expression with their gender identity, rather than the sex they were assigned at birth. source: [GLAAD](https://www.glaad.org/reference/transgender) 

- Sex: the classification of a person as male or female. At birth, infants are assigned a sex, usually based on the appearance of their external anatomy. (it is what is written on the birth certicate.) A person's sex, however, is actually a combination of bodily characteristics including: chromosomes, hormones, internal and external reproductive organs, and secondary sex characteristics.
