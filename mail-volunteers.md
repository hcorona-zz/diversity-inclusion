Dear Student Volunteers co-chairs, we are [xxxx], the Accessibility, Diversity and Inclusion co-chair at the conference [xxxx].

We have been contacted by SIGCHI with some important guidelines that we would like to follow in order to make the conference [xxxx] more accessible.
We would like to highlight some of the tasks that the student volunteersshould take if we need to assist people with accessibility requirements (according to the [guidelines from SIGHCHI](http://www.sigaccess.org/welcome-to-sigaccess/resources/accessible-conference-guide/#website)).

* When deciding how many student volunteers are needed, consider that student volunteer duties might include assisting attendees with accessibility requests, such as guiding people to the restrooms or helping at a buffet.
* Make student volunteers available to attendees who request assistance.
* A few seats in the front and back rows of each session room should be reserved for people with disabilities, pregnant women, or other people who need easy access to seating.Â Student volunteers will need to mark or reserve these seats, so they are not accidentally used by nondisabled attendees who could sit elsewhere.
* Based on requests made during registration process, provide access to any specialty devices or student volunteer assistance that may be needed (e.g., TTY access, an SV to guide and describe artwork or demonstrations)
* A presenter with a visual impairment may request assistance from a student volunteer to advance slides. The session chair, or a volunteer, can also facilitate question asking 

Could you please brief both inform the student volunteers when applying, and brief them once selected? 
It is mportant that hey know their support and collaboration is needed.

If you have any questions, please contact us at [mail@domain.reg], we am happy to provide guidance and support as much as needed to ensure we are a welcoming and inclusive conference for everyone.

Regards,
The Diversity, Inclusion and Accesibility Chairs.
