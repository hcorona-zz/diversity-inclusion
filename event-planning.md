# Conference Organization; Inclusion and Accesibility Recommendations
 
## Introduction 
This document is updated following the [SIGACCESS accessible conference guide (version 2.6)](http://www.sigaccess.org/welcome-to-sigaccess/resources/accessible-conference-guide/#communicating) which covers the most important accessibility needs. Thus, the focus of this document is to expland on it, based on other resources such as [https://github.com/numfocus/DISCOVER-Cookbook](https://github.com/numfocus/DISCOVER-Cookbook) and [https://sparcopen.github.io/opencon-dei-report/index.html](https://sparcopen.github.io/opencon-dei-report/index.html)


### Aditional Resources 
Some communities have specific accessibility needs that are not detailed in this document. Please read the following resources to ensure your event is accessible to everyone:

## Collecting Accessibility and Health Information in Advance, Ask!

While we encourage conference planners to design their event in a way that is accessible as possible, participants should also be asked about any specific accessibility needs in advance (at paper aceptance time or when registering). This could be done through a pre-conference email or collected through a question in the conference registration form. 

Depending on the budget, information collected could include specific access needs (e.g. sign language interpreters, transcription, visual impairments), health requests, and dietary constraints. Offer the option of discussing accessibility needs over the phone; this can minimize forming assumptions about the needs of the participant. Pleae reserve enough money into the conference budget to fund any requests. 


## General Venue Accesibility 

Explicit information about building accessibility should be made available to attendees before they arrive to the conference (e.g. is it wheelchair accessible? Are there accessible bathrooms/toilets in the venue building? If there are stairs, how many are there?) 

- [ ] :apple: Are there ramps and elevator access?
- [ ] Do any stairs have handrails?
- [ ] Are doors easy to open?
- [ ] :bulb: Is it a wheelchair accessible space with wheelchair accessible bathrooms?
- [ ] :apple: :bulb: Reserve easily-accesible seats for folks who might need it (wheelchair, crutches, cane, etc.)
- [ ] Create wide aisles between chairs to make it easier for people who are mobility-impaired to navigate the room.
- [ ] Reduce conference sprawl to support access for people who are mobility-impaired.

### Disability
- [ ] :apple: Provide large-text signs and easy-to-read maps. Include maps in advance, with the event schedule.
- [ ] :apple: :bulb: Make sure that hand-held microphones are available
- [ ] :apple: :bulb: Encourage session chairs to repeat questions from the audience over the mic so everyone can hear
- [ ] Consider using patterns rather than just color on signs and presentation slides to indicate differences, to make comprehension easier for attendees with color blindness/low vision issues.
- [ ] :question: closed captioning can be provided either in real time, or once the talk videos are put online to be more inclusive to those with hearing impairments and those with English as a second language 

## Gender-Neutral Bathrooms

Make sure that gender neutral bathrooms are easily accessible in the building(s) where the conference is being held. Gender neutral bathrooms are bathrooms that anyone can use, regardless of gender identity. Unlike male/female bathrooms, which exclude transgender people and those who identify outside the gender binary, gender neutral bathrooms are inclusive of all gender identities. 

- How to re-label bathrooms if the venue signs are traditional (men/women) rooms:
  - &quot;With Urinals&quot; / &quot;Without Urinals&quot;
  - &quot;All Gender Restroom&quot;
  - &quot;No Assumptions. No Gender Roles. Just Toilets.&quot;
- :apple: Provide tampons and pads in **all** restrooms (some people who identify as male have periods and may need them)

## :apple: Nursing & Pumping Room / Gender-Neutral Bottle Feeding Room
- [ ] :question: Will there be any parents with babies in the conference? 
- [ ] The rooms should be clearly labeled to prevent accidental entry, and their locations should be provided in both the print and the online conference directory and maps.
- [ ] Don't allow anyone (even organizers) to use the room for other purposes.
- [ ] Ensure there is a dedicated, single-occupancy space with lock.
- [ ] Bottle-fed babies can be fed by caregivers of any gender and also benefit from a quiet, low-distraction, private space for feeding. This should be a separate, additional room ( **NOT the same as the nursing and pumping room** )

## :apple: :bulb: Quiet Room

- [ ] A dedicated room for people who need a break from the stimulation of being surrounded by people at the conference, or just needs a quiet space away from the main conference
- [ ] Label the room accordingly.
    - No phone calls, talking/socializing, etc.
    - Put notifications on silent/vibrate.
 
## :apple: :bulb: Prayer Room
- [ ] Some faiths require prayer at different points of the day. To accommodate this, it’s important to make a quiet room available for those who need to pray. Tell participants in advance that this room will be available in conference communications.

## Remote Access: Live Stream
- [ ] A high quality live webcast can be made available on our website, enabling attendees to watch sessions in real time, even when they are not able to attend the session for any reasons (due to visa issues, travel cancelations, etc)

## Dietary Restrictions and Allergies

- Common dietary needs to plan for: *Gluten free, Dairy free, Vegan, Vegetarian, Pork free, Shellfish free, Soy free, Nut free, Kosher, Halal.*
- [ ] :apple: :bulb: :question: When registering for the conference, ask participants to submit any information about dietary restrictions (food allergies, preferences, or religious restrictions). This should be taken into account when ordering meals and catering for participants.
- [ ] :bulb: We would recommend ordering more vegetarian/vegan options than required, as they can be eaten by most participants and can help ensure you don’t run out of meal options for participants with many dietary restrictions.
    - All foods should be clearly and accurately labeled. For example, by having a sign/small label in front of each dish with a list of ingredients and common labels (Ask your caterer to create and provide the labels)
- [ ]  Make sure that there is easy access to drinking water throughout the day in the venue.) 
- [ ]  Make sure to include a variety of beverages, in particular non-alcoholic and non-caffeinated.

## Pronoun Ribbons
participants can be encouraged to attach a ribbon to their conference badge indicating which gender pronoun they prefer (he, she, they, etc.), which should be provided at the registration desk. More information about pronoun ribbons, including the template for the ribbons used at OpenCon, can be found here: http://www.pronounribbons.org/ 

## Q&A Facilitation

- [ ]  :apple: :bulb: Require that whoever is facilitating the Q&A be cognizant of *who* is requesting to ask questions. We believe the voices represented in the Q&A discussion should reflect the diversity of the participants, and trying to achieve this means active intervention from facilitators and moderators. Facilitators prioritize questions from those who haven’t yet had a chance to speak. Actively discuss and coordinate this approach with moderators in advance.
- [ ]   We would strongly recommend that conference organizers use wireless microphones (or another method that allows the moderator to decide who asks the next question) if at all possible, rather than placing microphones at the front of the room. 
- [ ]  Using a first come-first serve basis for asking question privileges the most confident voices in the room, and important reactions often come from those who might take a few moments to collect their thoughts or find their voice.

## Parent-Friendly Events
In order to create a space that’s inclusive of participants who are parents bringing along small children to the conference, certain additions to the maternity room can be made. Suggestions taken from this article on child friendly conferences might include:
- [ ] :question: ask, are there any parents planning to bring their kids to the conference?
- [ ] :apple: Making the agenda public as early as possible so parents can plan accordingly
- [ ] :apple: Collect the data on the registration form. How many people would make use of childcare services or grants?
- [ ] :bulb: List of local children’s resources
- [ ]  Explicitly allowing children in sessions
- [ ]  Providing childcare, or listing local childcare providers/options
    - [ ]  Offer financial support for childcare.
    - [ ]  Build it into your budget: Link it to sponsorships or add an option to the registration, e.g.: &quot;Donate $20 to help with childcare costs.&quot;
    
## Social Events - Inclusion
- [ ]  :apple: Make all attendees aware that it is their responsability to provide an inclusive enviroment. For example, by following the suggestion in the [SIGACCESS Accessibility conference planning Appendix C](http://www.sigaccess.org/welcome-to-sigaccess/resources/accessible-conference-guide/#communicating) 
- [ ]  :apple: When talking to someone, do not assume their gender.
- [ ]  :apple: Ensure ASL Interpreters and/or any other attendee assistant can attend all social events. 

## Social Events - Alcohol-Free Events

Some of our nighttime social events include alcohol consumption. However, some participants may not be able to sit a table where someone is consuming alcohol, for religious or personal reasons. 
- [ ]  :apple: Ensure there are spaces at receptions where alcohol is not being consumed, and explore the option of incorporating alcohol-free events into the evening program. 
- [ ]  :apple: :bulb: Consider diversifying the time of day that social events happen. Not everyone is available (physically or mentally) in the evenings, when social events are typically concentrated.

## Inclusive practices during check-in
- [ ]  Managing photography opt-outs using lanyards or ribbons: (green = photos fine; yellow = ask first; red = no photos) 
- [ ]  Ribbons for badges can be useful, e.g. **First-Time Attendee.**: Consider what visual cues would encourage people to engage with one another and go out of their way to be friendly to someone.
- [ ]  Consider running a mentoring program that matches experienced attendees with first-timers for networking and to provide a friendly resource to get to know the conference.

## Collecting Feedback
- [ ] After the event, identify areas for improvement. Send out an event feedback form that includes a question on whether participant accessibility needs were met. 

## Funding Travel for people with Accessibility needs
- [ ] For those receiving travel scholarships, we strongly recommend that any additional travel costs incurred due to accessibility considerations be covered by conference organizers—not the participant.
